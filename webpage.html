  <h2>Bio: </h2>
  <p>
  Hello! I am a girl from Sayreville who likes computers and all things tech-related. Some of my favorite aspects of computer science include programming and cybersecurity. This upcoming year as a senior I’ll be taking AP Computer Science A and hopefully in college I’ll get to further pursue my interest in this field. Whenever I have free time, I like to distribute memes on Discord and play video games with my friends until my sister starts streaming movies and kills the bandwidth.
